=== YOUR TASKS ===

TASK 1: Find 3-5 key interactions
- Pick interactions that show new content OR go to new pages OR open modals
- Use element IDs like [el_1] or selectors from the list above
- Focus on: navigation links, forms, buttons, modal triggers, important features
- IMPORTANT: Include buttons that open login/signup modals
- Include buttons that reveal additional form fields

TASK 2: Find ALL links to follow
- Look for: links, buttons, menu items, tabs that go to new pages
- Include login buttons that open modals with forms
- Include buttons that change page state (filters, toggles, accordions)
- Modern websites use div/span as buttons - check all element types
- DO NOT skip elements - list ALL that could navigate or change state

RULES:
✓ Only use element IDs and selectors from the INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS list
✓ Buttons and divs can be navigation elements, not just <a> tags
✓ If you see a modal or popup with a login form, include it
✓ Look at element labels and placeholders to understand what they do
